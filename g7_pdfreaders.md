summary: |-
  PDF readers are a widely used software tool, especially for students who spend considerable time reading e-books and study materials. This project explores the energy consumption of different PDF readers in various scenarios to provide insights into energy-efficient software choices. Our findings aim to help students and other users extend battery life, minimize environmental impact, and enhance user experience through informed software selection.

## Introduction

### Importance of Energy-Efficient Software

PDF readers are crucial for many users, particularly students who rely on them to read e-books and other study materials. Considering that students typically spend hours using these applications on their laptops, energy efficiency becomes a key factor. Prolonged use of power-hungry software can lead to frequent charging, reduced battery life, and overall environmental impact.

This report compares the energy consumption of multiple PDF readers in various scenarios, focusing on settings most relevant to student use cases. By understanding the energy consumption patterns, we aim to suggest the most efficient choices for students who want to maximize their battery life and reduce their carbon footprint.

## Research Objective

This project aims to investigate and compare the energy consumption of different PDF readers across the following dimensions:
**Different PDF Reader Applications** - Comparing different PDF reader apps for the same use case.

The ultimate goal is to provide insights into energy-efficient software choices for common use cases.

## Methodology

### Experiment Setup

To ensure unbiased and accurate energy consumption data, we have adhered to the following best practices:

1. **Zen Mode Configuration**: During the experiments, all non-essential applications and services were turned off. Notifications were disabled, and unnecessary hardware (e.g., external drives, displays) was disconnected. This ensured that the only variable affecting energy consumption was the PDF reader.
   
2. **Fixed System Settings**: To maintain consistency across tests, system settings such as screen brightness and resolution were fixed throughout the experiment. Any potential energy-saving features, like automatic brightness adjustment, were disabled to avoid interference.

3. **Measurement Tools**: 

### PDF Readers Tested

We selected a set of commonly used PDF readers for this study:
- **Adobe Acrobat Reader**: A feature-rich, widely used PDF reader.

### Test Scenarios

We performed our tests in the following configurations:
   
**App Comparison**: We compared the energy consumption of different PDF readers while performing the same task, such as reading a 50-page PDF file.
